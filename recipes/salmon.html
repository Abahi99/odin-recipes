    <h2>Steps To Make Garlic Butter Baked Salmon</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400ºF. Line a baking sheet that is large enough to fold over and seal the fish.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, add lemon juice, garlic, and melted butter or melted ghee and whisk until combined.</li>
        <li>Place the salmon on the prepared baking sheet and then pour the butter mixture over the salmon, careful to keep as much as the butter mixture on the salmon.</li>
        <li>Season with salt, pepper, oregano, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Fold the sides of the foil over the salmon so that the salmon is fully sealed and the butter mixture cannot leak out.</li>
        <li>Place the sheet pan into the oven, and bake until cooked, about 12-16 minutes.</li>
        <li>Open the foil, and broil the fish for 2-3 minutes until the tops are golden. Be careful not to burn the fish by keeping a close eye on it.</li>
        <li>Remove the sheet pan from the oven. Then, using a spoon, pour some of the butter sauce left in the foil onto the salmon and garnish before serving.</li>
    </ol>
